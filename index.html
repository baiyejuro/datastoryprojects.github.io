									<p>Texus Electronics, a leading technology distributor, is at the forefront of the ever-evolving electronics industry. We were contacted to build a dynamic and responsive dashboard to track some essential KPIs. Along the process of analysing the data, we came up with two distinct dashboards (Descriptive and Diagnostic Dashboards). These dashboards helped the organization gain real-time insights, and improve data-driven decision making processes which ultimately enhance overall business performance.

										<h2><a href="#">MEKKO RETAIL INC: CUSTOMER DEMOGRAPHICS & PREFERENCES ANALYSIS USING MS EXCEL</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/istockphoto-1138429558-612x612.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>MEKKO Retail Inc. is a global retail chain with multiple departments ranging from Books to Automotive. With its vast presence in different countries, it serves millions of customers daily. As the company expands, it's becoming increasingly challenging for the management to keep track of customer demographics, preferences, and other vital details that can help in improving sales and customer satisfaction. The raw data makes it difficult to draw insights and make strategic decisions, leading to missed opportunities. We leveraged an interactive dashboard in Excel to visualize the data and help the management easily spot trends, understand customer preferences based on demographics, and make informed decisions.</p>
